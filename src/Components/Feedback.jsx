                I keep taking cars on rent. I have taken at least 10-12 times and every time I paid so much higher rent until I found Mysawari. I have taken rent from Mysawari for the last 2 times and Iâ€™ll always take from Mysawari now because their rates are much lower than all other agencies and cars are well maintained</p>

I checked at least 5-6 agencies. Mysawari rates were the lowest. The Dzire car that I took on rent was very well maintained and I had a wonderful Dawki Trip. Whenever my friends ask, I always suggest them Mysawari.</p>
